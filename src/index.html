        <h1>Hello there!</h1>
        <p> My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sultanova-anahit-8323a0a4/" target="_blank"><b> Sultanova Anahit </b></a> and I'm web-frontend developer! </p>
        <p> In this <a href="https://github.com/soltonanna/javascript_examples">repository</a> you can find some Code Challenges and examples of exercises, which I solved during learning JavaScript. </p>
        <p> It can be some Portfolio for me, as JS developer and maybe you can find here some interesting codes for interviews or self-development </p>
        <br /><br />

        <p id="help_info"> The each Code_Challenge is in a separate folder, which consist <b>README.txt</b> file, where you can find the task description. <br />Also there are <b>js</b> and <b>html / css</b> files if them needed. You can run and check Projects which have index.html  file in browser, otherwise use node-js for checking in terminal. Also there are some thematic folders about arrays, functions and etc.</p>
